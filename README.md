# Caesar-Cipher
In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques.

Advantages of using a Caesar cipher include:
-One of the easiest methods to use in cryptography and can provide minimum security to the information.
-Use of only a short key in the entire process.
-One of the best methods to use if the system cannot use any complicated coding techniques.
